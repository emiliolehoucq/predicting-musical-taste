# Predicting musical taste

This is the data, code, and findings for a project I conducted with [Anna Michelson](https://www.mcpherson.edu/directory/anna-michelson/).

We expored people's musical tastes. Specifically, we predicted people's taste for classical music, country, and rock & oldies.

Our results were interesting, but unsurprising, so we didn't pursue a publication.

# Predicting musical taste

This is the data, code, and graphs for a project in which I predicted people's taste for classical music, country, and rock & oldies. I am thankful to [Anna Michelson](https://www.mcpherson.edu/directory/anna-michelson/) for helping me to think about the data from her expertise in the sociology of music.
